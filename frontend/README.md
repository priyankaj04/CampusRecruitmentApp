The Campus Recruitment Management System (CRMS) is a specialized job portal designed specifically for colleges. It enables students to apply for job opportunities available on their campus, making the recruitment process smoother and more efficient. CRMS facilitates easy connections between recruiters and campus talent, ensuring a streamlined and effective campus recruitment process.


## Users and Roles


There are four main types of users in the CRMS, each with distinct access levels and login credentials:

1. <b>`Students`</b>: Students can view and apply for job openings posted by recruiters on the platform.
   
2. <b>`Recruiters`</b>: Recruiters can post job openings, review applications, and manage the recruitment process.
 
3. <b>`Admin`</b>: Admins oversee the platform's operations, manage users, verifies job opening and ensure everything runs smoothly.
 
4. <b>`HOD (Head of Department)`</b>: The HOD will update their department's syllabus, which helps recruiters better understand students' qualifications.


## Tech Stack


The CRMS is built using the following technologies:

1. <b>`Node.js`</b>: Server-side runtime for building fast and scalable network applications.
   
2. <b>`Express.js`</b>: Web application framework for Node.js, used to build the backend.
 
3. <b>`React Native`</b>: Framework for building mobile applications with React.
 
4. <b>`PostgreSQL`</b>: Relational database used to store and manage the application data.
